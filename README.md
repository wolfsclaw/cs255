<b>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</b><br>
<br>
DriverPass wanted to address the issue of a gap in the driver education system, where more than 65% of those who took their driving tests failed.  The purpose of this project was to provide the opportunity for people to be able to take practice tests and have driving training.  This will hopefully turn the bad test driving scores around.<br>
<br>
<b>What did you do particularly well?</b><br>
<br>
I feel that I did the creation of the charts well.  I tried to make the charts easy to understand.<br>
<br>
<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b><br>
<br>
I would have revised the gantt chart.  I needed to break it down more and make sure that all tasks were listed out.<br>
<br>
<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b><br>
<br>
I tried my best to ensure that my system design was built for ease to make it easier for the users.  Considering the user's needs is vital to a successful application.  If the user does not like the application, they will not use it.  They will also tell other people not to use it.  To have a successful application you must ensure that the users are comfortable with the application to use it.<br>
<br>
<b>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</b><br>
<br>
I would approach designing software by understanding the needs of the client and also using best practices in ensuring that the software is done to the best of my ability.  I would also try to listen to the ideas of those around me.
